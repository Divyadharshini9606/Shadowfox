TASK 1 : This project implements a Boston House Price Prediction regression model using Python's scikit-learn library.
The solution utilizes a dataset containing key features like number of rooms, crime rates, and other local factors to predict median house values. 
The process follows a standard machine learning workflow, including data preprocessing (cleaning, scaling features using StandardScaler), model training (employing Linear Regression as the baseline algorithm), and evaluation. 
The model's predictive accuracy is quantified using key metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and the R2 Score, providing a robust, data-driven tool for estimating property values in the Boston real estate market.

TASK 2: This project develops a Car Selling Price Prediction model using Python's machine learning libraries. 
The solution leverages a dataset containing key features such as fuel type, years of service, showroom price, number of previous owners, kilometers driven, seller type, and transmission type to predict the selling price of used cars.
The workflow follows a standard data science pipeline, including data preprocessing (handling missing values and performing one-hot encoding for categorical variables), model training (using a Random Forest Regressor), and evaluation.
Model performance is assessed using metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and RÂ² Score, providing a reliable and data-driven tool for estimating used car prices.

TASK 3: This project implements a Customer Support Automation system as part of an AI/ML internship.
The solution leverages state-of-the-art LLMs (BERT, GPT-3, and LLaMA) to provide context-aware, accurate, and personalized responses to customer queries. 
The workflow follows a production-ready approach, including intent recognition and context understanding using BERT, response generation with GPT-3 and LLaMA, and knowledge integration via a proprietary knowledge base. 
The system also incorporates performance evaluation using metrics to measure response quality and relevance, along with an interactive Gradio interface for testing and demonstration.
This project highlights expertise in NLP, LLM deployment, AI-driven automation, prompt engineering, and building interactive AI applications.
